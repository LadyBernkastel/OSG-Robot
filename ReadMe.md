# Animated Open Scene Graph Robot

This project was created for my University Computer Graphics module. A basic OSG was given to us along with a model of a robotic arm. The assignment was to use the features of OSG to allow animation, selection, highlighting and such of the robotic arm.

This project won't run if downloaded as the compiled OSG source & robot file haven't been included for brevity. The assignment code has been.

Most of the coding was done in C++ and in the end I was able to select a part of the robot using the mouse and stop/start animation of that part on a key press. Recorded animation states was also included, allowing a user to press a key to record a given robot position then trigger the robot to move to each of the recorded positions in sequence.
